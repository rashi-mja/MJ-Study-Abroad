                    The TOEFL iBT test consists of four sections: Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing. Each section evaluates different aspects of English language proficiency, and scores range from 0 to 120 in total. The test is designed to measure how well a student can use English in an academic environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Reading section comprises academic passages with multiple-choice questions that assess comprehension, vocabulary, and inference skills. The Listening section evaluates the ability to understand spoken English in conversations and lectures. The Speaking section consists of four tasks that test pronunciation, fluency, and coherence in responses. The Writing section includes two tasks that require essay-style responses, assessing grammar, coherence, and argument strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the TOEFL is an internet-based test (iBT), test-takers should be comfortable with typing essays, listening to digital audio recordings, and responding through a microphone. Familiarity with the test format can greatly enhance performance on exam day.

                    The TOEFL Reading section tests your ability to comprehend and analyze academic texts. The passages are often sourced from university-level textbooks, covering subjects like history, science, and humanities. Test-takers must develop the ability to identify main ideas, infer meanings, and understand vocabulary in context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A strong reading habit is key to excelling in this section. Regularly reading academic articles from sources such as National Geographic, The New York Times, and BBC News can help improve comprehension speed and vocabulary. Additionally, practicing TOEFL reading questions will enhance your ability to tackle factual, inference-based, and vocabulary questions efficiently.

                    The TOEFL Listening section assesses your ability to understand spoken English in academic conversations and lectures. The section includes multiple types of questions, such as understanding details, recognizing a speakerâ€™s attitude, and inferring meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To improve listening skills, it is beneficial to expose yourself to various English accents and speech patterns. Watching English documentaries, university lectures, and TED Talks can train your ears to recognize different intonations and key information quickly. Taking notes while listening to audio clips will also help in retaining information and answering questions more effectively.

                    The TOEFL Speaking section evaluates how well you can express yourself in English under timed conditions. It consists of independent and integrated tasks, requiring you to speak on familiar topics and respond to academic materials.

                <p>
                    To perform well, it is essential to develop fluency and clarity in speech. Practicing speaking English daily, recording responses, and analyzing pronunciation can significantly enhance performance. Using structured templates for answering questions can also provide coherence to responses. Additionally, using platforms like Duolingo English Practice or language exchange apps can provide real-time speaking practice.

                    The TOEFL Writing section consists of two tasks: an Integrated Task and an Independent Task. The Integrated Task involves reading a passage, listening to a lecture, and then writing a response summarizing and comparing key points. The Independent Task requires test-takers to express their opinion on a given topic, supporting their argument with examples.

                <p>
                    To excel in writing, practicing structured essays using templates can be beneficial. A good essay should have a clear thesis, well-organized paragraphs, and strong supporting arguments. Additionally, grammar and coherence play a vital role in achieving a high score, making grammar revision an essential part of preparation.

                    Developing a study plan is crucial for TOEFL success. Depending on your proficiency level, you may need anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks of preparation.
